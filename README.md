Since the whole idea is to show beautiful pictures taken from NASA, I left UI very simple looking.
But the functionality is not that simple. 

> Disclamer: The very first picture taken goes back to 1995-06-16. So keep that in mind if you enter earlier dates it won't work.

- User can input a date
- get a random image 
- localStorage 

> if it's the first time that user opens the website on their browser, the very first picture that gets uploaded will be the picture according to today's date. If not, the user's input date or random image date will be saved and relative picture will be shown the next time they open the site.
